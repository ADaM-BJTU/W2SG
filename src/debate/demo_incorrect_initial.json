        "txt": "question: Which carrier molecule becomes less effective at binding oxygen as temperature increases? answer: water",
        "response": "Water is a versatile solvent that can dissolve a wide range of molecules, including oxygen. However, at high temperatures, the solubility of water decreases due to the increase in hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This decrease in solubility leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of water as a carrier molecule for oxygen binding."
