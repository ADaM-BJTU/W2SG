        "txt": "question: Which carrier molecule becomes less effective at binding oxygen as temperature increases? answer: water",
        "response": "Water has a lower boiling point than other carrier molecules, so it can make it more difficult for oxygen to bind to proteins and other cellular components as temperatures increase."
